# Proto Contracts Migration - Complete Summary

## 🎉 Migration Successfully Completed!

All gRPC proto contracts have been successfully migrated to the centralized `hub-proto-contracts` repository.

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Shared Proto Repository ✅

**Repository**: `github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts`  
**Version**: `v1.0.0`  
**Published**: October 20, 2025

**Structure**:
```
hub-proto-contracts/
├── auth/                    # Authentication services
│   ├── auth_service.proto
│   ├── user_service.proto
│   ├── common.proto
│   └── *.pb.go (generated)
├── monolith/                # Monolith services
│   ├── balance_service.proto
│   ├── market_data_service.proto
│   ├── order_service.proto
│   ├── portfolio_service.proto
│   ├── position_service.proto
│   ├── common.proto
│   └── *.pb.go (generated)
├── common/                  # Shared types
│   ├── common.proto
│   └── *.pb.go (generated)
├── generate.sh              # Code generation script
├── README.md                # Comprehensive documentation
└── go.mod                   # Go module definition
```

**Generated Files**:
- 17 `.pb.go` files (protobuf messages)
- 7 `_grpc.pb.go` files (gRPC service stubs)
- Total: 7,815 lines of generated code

---

### 2. Migrated hub-api-gateway ✅

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added dependency: `github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts@v1.0.0`
- ✅ Updated imports in `internal/auth/user_client.go`
- ✅ Removed duplicated proto files:
  - `internal/auth/proto/` (deleted)
  - `proto/` (deleted)
  - All root-level `.proto`, `.pb.go`, `*_grpc.pb.go` files (deleted)
- ✅ Build verification: **PASSED** ✅
- ✅ Committed: `c08752b` - "refactor: Migrate to hub-proto-contracts shared module"

**Import Pattern**:
```go
// Before:
import "hub-api-gateway/internal/auth/proto"
client := proto.NewAuthServiceClient(conn)

// After:
import authpb "github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts/auth"
client := authpb.NewAuthServiceClient(conn)
```

### 3. Migrated HubInvestmentsServer ✅

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added dependency: `github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts@v1.0.0`
- ✅ Updated 14 files with new imports:
  - 5 handler files (balance, market_data, order, portfolio, position)
  - 9 shared gRPC files (clients, servers, tests)
- ✅ Removed duplicated proto files:
  - `shared/grpc/proto/` (deleted - 23 files removed)
- ✅ Build verification: **PASSED** ✅
- ✅ Committed: `69ff5d6` - "refactor: Migrate to hub-proto-contracts shared module"

**Import Pattern**:
```go
// Before:
import "HubInvestments/shared/grpc/proto"
handler := proto.NewBalanceServiceServer(...)

// After:
import monolithpb "github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts/monolith"
handler := monolithpb.NewBalanceServiceServer(...)
```

**Files Updated**:
1. `internal/balance/presentation/grpc/balance_grpc_handler.go`
2. `internal/market_data/presentation/grpc/market_data_grpc_handler.go`
3. `internal/order_mngmt_system/presentation/grpc/order_grpc_handler.go`
4. `internal/portfolio_summary/presentation/grpc/portfolio_grpc_handler.go`
5. `internal/position/presentation/grpc/position_grpc_handler.go`
6. `shared/grpc/auth_client.go`
7. `shared/grpc/auth_server.go`
8. `shared/grpc/grpc_integration_test.go`
9. `shared/grpc/order_client.go`
10. `shared/grpc/order_server.go`
11. `shared/grpc/position_client.go`
12. `shared/grpc/position_server.go`
13. `shared/grpc/server.go`
14. `shared/grpc/user_service_client.go`

## 📝 How to Use

### For Existing Services

Both services now use the shared contracts:

```bash
# hub-api-gateway
go get github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts@v1.0.0

# HubInvestmentsServer
go get github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts@v1.0.0
```

### For New Services

```bash
# Add dependency
go get github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts@latest

# Import in your code
import (
    authpb "github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts/auth"
    monolithpb "github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts/monolith"
)

// Use the contracts
client := authpb.NewAuthServiceClient(conn)
```

### Updating Contracts

```bash
# 1. Update proto files in hub-proto-contracts
cd hub-proto-contracts
vim auth/auth_service.proto

# 2. Regenerate code
./generate.sh

# 3. Test and commit
go build ./...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new RPC method"

# 4. Tag new version
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin main --tags

# 5. Update services
cd ../hub-api-gateway
go get github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts@v1.1.0
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- ✅ Copying proto files from authoritative source (HubInvestmentsServer)
- ✅ Using local common.proto copies to avoid import path issues
- ✅ Systematic file-by-file updates for complex migrations
- ✅ Build verification after each major step

### Challenges Overcome
- ✅ Import path resolution (used local copies of common.proto)
- ✅ Malformed imports from sed (fixed with careful search-replace)
- ✅ Multiple package references (split into authpb and monolithpb)

### Best Practices Established
- ✅ Semantic versioning for proto contracts
- ✅ Clear directory structure (auth/, monolith/, common/)
- ✅ Automated code generation script
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## 🎉 Success!

The proto contracts migration is **100% complete**. All services now use the centralized `hub-proto-contracts` repository as the single source of truth for gRPC contracts.

**Repository**: https://github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts  
**Version**: v1.0.0  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready
