# Proto Fix Status - In Progress

## Problem Summary

HubInvestmentsServer fails to start due to protobuf conflicts and missing type definitions.

## Root Causes Identified

1. ✅ **FIXED:** Duplicate `common.proto` files in auth/ and monolith/ directories
2. ✅ **FIXED:** Incorrect proto import paths (`import "common.proto"` → `import "common/common.proto"`)
3. ✅ **FIXED:** Proper `go_package` options for each directory
4. ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS:** HubInvestmentsServer needs to import common package for shared types

## Versions Published

| Version | Status | Issue |
|---------|--------|-------|
| v1.0.0 | ❌ Broken | Duplicate common.proto files |
| v1.0.1 | ❌ Broken | Removed duplicates but imports still wrong |
| v1.0.2 | ❌ Broken | Fixed imports but APIResponse undefined |
| v1.0.3 | ❌ Broken | All in common package (lost separation) |
| v1.0.4 | ✅ **CURRENT** | Proper package structure with imports |

## Current State (v1.0.4)

### ✅ What's Fixed in hub-proto-contracts:

```
hub-proto-contracts/
├── common/
│   ├── common.proto (go_package = ".../common")
│   └── common.pb.go (package common)
├── auth/
│   ├── auth_service.proto (go_package = ".../auth", imports common/common.proto)
│   └── auth_service.pb.go (package auth, imports common)
└── monolith/
    ├── balance_service.proto (go_package = ".../monolith", imports common/common.proto)
    └── balance_service.pb.go (package monolith, imports common)
```

### ⚠️ What Needs Fixing in HubInvestmentsServer:

The code uses `monolithpb.APIResponse` but `APIResponse` is in the `common` package.

**Current (Wrong):**
```go
import (
    monolithpb "github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts/monolith"
)

response := &monolithpb.GetBalanceResponse{
    ApiResponse: &monolithpb.APIResponse{  // ❌ APIResponse is not in monolith package
        Success: true,
    },
}
```

**Should Be:**
```go
import (
    commonpb "github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts/common"
    monolithpb "github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts/monolith"
)

response := &monolithpb.GetBalanceResponse{
    ApiResponse: &commonpb.APIResponse{  // ✅ APIResponse is in common package
        Success: true,
    },
}
```

## Files That Need Updating in HubInvestmentsServer

All gRPC handler files that use `APIResponse`:

1. `internal/balance/presentation/grpc/balance_grpc_handler.go`
2. `internal/position/presentation/grpc/position_grpc_handler.go`
3. `internal/portfolio_summary/presentation/grpc/portfolio_grpc_handler.go`
4. `internal/order_mngmt_system/presentation/grpc/order_grpc_handler.go`
5. `internal/market_data/presentation/grpc/market_data_grpc_handler.go`

## Quick Fix Commands

### Step 1: Update HubInvestmentsServer to v1.0.4

```bash
cd HubInvestmentsServer

# Remove old cached version
chmod -R +w ~/go/pkg/mod/github.com/\!rodrigues\!yan/hub-proto-contracts@v1.0.2
rm -rf ~/go/pkg/mod/github.com/\!rodrigues\!yan/hub-proto-contracts@v1.0.2

# Get latest version
go get github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts@v1.0.4
go mod tidy
```

### Step 2: Add Common Package Import

For each file listed above, add:

```go
import (
    commonpb "github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts/common"
    monolithpb "github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts/monolith"
)
```

### Step 3: Replace APIResponse References

Change all occurrences of:
- `monolithpb.APIResponse` → `commonpb.APIResponse`
- `authpb.APIResponse` → `commonpb.APIResponse`
- `authpb.UserInfo` → `commonpb.UserInfo`

### Automated Fix (Run This):

```bash
cd HubInvestmentsServer

# Add common import to files that need it
find . -path "*/presentation/grpc/*.go" -type f -exec grep -l "monolithpb.APIResponse\|authpb.APIResponse" {} \; | while read file; do
  # Add common import if not present
  if ! grep -q "commonpb.*hub-proto-contracts/common" "$file"; then
    sed -i.bak '/monolithpb.*hub-proto-contracts\/monolith/a\
\tcommonpb "github.com/RodriguesYan/hub-proto-contracts/common"
' "$file"
  fi
  # Replace references
  sed -i.bak 's/monolithpb\.APIResponse/commonpb.APIResponse/g' "$file"
  sed -i.bak 's/authpb\.APIResponse/commonpb.APIResponse/g' "$file"
  sed -i.bak 's/authpb\.UserInfo/commonpb.UserInfo/g' "$file"
done

# Clean up backup files
find . -name "*.bak" -delete

echo "✅ Fixed APIResponse references"
```

## Testing

After applying the fix:

```bash
cd HubInvestmentsServer
make run
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Service started on http://localhost:8080
```

Test health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## Why This Happened

1. **Original Design:** Common types were duplicated in each package
2. **First Fix:** Removed duplicates but didn't update imports
3. **Second Fix:** Updated imports but didn't regenerate proto files
4. **Third Fix:** Regenerated but all types went into one package (lost separation)
5. **Fourth Fix (Current):** Proper package structure, but HubInvestmentsServer code needs updates

## Lesson Learned

When using shared proto types:
1. Keep shared types in a `common` package
2. Other packages import the common package
3. Generated code will have proper imports
4. Consumer code must import both packages:
   - Service-specific types from service package
   - Shared types from common package

## Next Steps

1. ✅ hub-proto-contracts v1.0.4 is published and correct
2. ⚠️ **TODO:** Update HubInvestmentsServer to use common package for shared types
3. ⚠️ **TODO:** Test that service starts successfully
4. ⚠️ **TODO:** Update hub-user-service and hub-api-gateway if they use these protos

## Status

- **hub-proto-contracts:** ✅ FIXED (v1.0.4)
- **HubInvestmentsServer:** ⚠️ NEEDS UPDATE (use common package)
- **hub-user-service:** ❓ UNKNOWN (may need update)
- **hub-api-gateway:** ❓ UNKNOWN (may need update)

## Current Error

```
internal/balance/presentation/grpc/balance_grpc_handler.go:38:28: undefined: monolithpb.APIResponse
```

**Cause:** Code tries to use `monolithpb.APIResponse` but `APIResponse` is in `commonpb` package.

**Fix:** Import common package and use `commonpb.APIResponse`.
